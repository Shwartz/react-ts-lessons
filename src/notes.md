## Motivation

This tutorial aims to create a step by step examples on how to build a scalable Javascript applications.

There will be few Lesson cycles, where we will introduce you, to understand basic composition of reusable code. 
We slightly touch some functional code style  `functors`, `applicatives`, `Modnoids` etc, `Immutable` data structures and much more. 


In the lesson cycle, we will take simple counter app, to convert from a single component,
to full MVVM app. As dom manipulation library we will use React. 

We also try to explain some good tips, how to use React in your projects.

Counter app, with `React.Component` and stateless widget.

### Lesson 2

Extend Counter app, with `MVVM` external state controller.

### Lesson 3

Extend same app, with `functors`, and rebuild state controller to be more generic.

### Lesson 4
